                    <p>Demons are a carnivorous, vampire-like species whose primary diet is humans. They are also nocturnal as they are weak to sunlight, though they also stay up during the day as they don't require sleep. Demons have an abnormally powerful physical constitution and potent regenerative abilities, making them immune to normal weaponry and granting them the ability to heal from any wound with ease, even re-growing their head. Only the Nichirin Swords, weapons made from special ore with sunlight absorption properties, can inflict life-threatening wounds. However, even with a Nichirin Sword, the only method guaranteed to kill a demon is through decapitation. Demons are also known to hate wisteria, which are poisonous to them and whose smell is repudiated by them.</p>
