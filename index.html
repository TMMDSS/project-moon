                <p>Demons are a carnivorous, vampire-like species whose primary diet is humans. They are also nocturnal as they are weak to sunlight, though they also stay up during the day as they don't require sleep. Demons have an abnormally powerful physical constitution and potent regenerative abilities, making them immune to normal weaponry and granting them the ability to heal from any wound with ease, even re-growing their head. Only the Nichirin Swords, weapons made from special ore with sunlight absorption properties, can inflict life-threatening wounds. However, even with a Nichirin Sword, the only method guaranteed to kill a demon is through decapitation. Demons are also known to hate wisteria, which are poisonous to them and whose smell is repudiated by them.</p>
                <p>                 
                Practically all demons possess a murderous instinct to kill and devour humans, and have lost most of their memories from their human life. While they do still retain their original personality, most times it becomes a darker version of what it used to be, often corrupted by their core beliefs and their past. However, there are a few demons who have completely retained their human emotions and memories, such as Nezuko Kamado, Tamayo and Yushiro. Certain members of the Twelve Kizuki also retain their human memories such as Rui (though he eventually lost his memories later on), Kaigaku, Kyogai, Doma, and Kokushibo. All demons do regain their memories moments before they die, which possibly means that demons also have their lives flash before their eyes before they turn into complete ash.
